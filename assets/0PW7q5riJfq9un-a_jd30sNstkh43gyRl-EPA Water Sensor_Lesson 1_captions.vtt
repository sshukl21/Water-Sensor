00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.960
For ideas about buildings with a complex water
system and how water monitoring is useful,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.750
here is an example of a research building
on the Tempe campus of Arizona State University,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.060
located in the southwest desert.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.060
The variety of rooms in this building are
classrooms, meeting rooms, a museum, offices,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.270
labs, break rooms, and bathrooms.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.000
Water conservation is essential in the southwest
desert and this building was designed to conserve

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230
water and use water more efficiently.​

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.550
Water efficiency measures can result in water
spending more time traveling through the pipes

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.800
in the building.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.690
For water that sits in pipes, deterioration
can be a factor the longer it sits stagnant.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.180
Standing water in pipes may foster bacteria
growth and metal leaching from the pipes.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.970
Neither of those sound good, right?​

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.810
​So how do building operators typically
monitor water quality for safety?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.110
Unsafe water monitoring is typically done
by manual water sampling throughout the building.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.229
Then water quality analysis is done by a testing
lab.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.100
The process is time and labor intensive.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.499
That’s where monitoring water quality real-time
is beneficial.

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:25.469
Timely data gathering helps with taking prompt
corrective action if needed.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.340
This is a water quality sensor installed under
a break room sink.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.070
The sensor monitors pH, conductivity, temperature,
dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770
and chlorine.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.319
The measurements are useful for detecting
changes in the water being supplied by the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:50.099
city and deterioration in water quality in
the building due to low water use.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.079
City water often has a disinfectant chemical
residual of chlorine.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.130
If chlorine is not detected in the water,
it suggests the water has been stagnant for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.600
a long time and increased water use is needed
such as flushing faucets.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.509
The key water monitoring innovation with mobile
sensor kits is the ability to monitor water

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.890
quality in real-time and transmit the data
to a computer or the internet.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.890
This is the data dashboard for the water sensor
package located under the break room sink.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.640
Readings for chlorine, oxidation-reduction
potential or ORP, and temperature are displayed

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.520
providing ability to visualize the data over
time.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.700
This project is monitoring water quality at
a weekly interval by floor in the building.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.680
The data helped identify changes occurring
that might need attention, such as times when

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.790
the chlorine level is too low.​
Dashboards can be made as simple or sophisticated

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.680
as desired, and there are existing software
and apps available to create dashboards.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.130
​
You can determine what information will be

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.989
useful to your tracking and analysis.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.000
For example, is data visualization enough,
or do you want to be able to analyze and/or

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.760
download the data.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.180
What is the timeframe for the data?

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.209
Thinking through the information you want
to get from the data dashboard provides direction

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.430
on how to get there.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.790
​
Here are a few considerations when creating,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.689
installing, and using a water sensor package.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.150
​First know the building and plumbing codes

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.620
and permitting requirements.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.540
It is critical that the water sensor package
follow applicable plumbing codes and go through

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.030
the proper approval process.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.540
​Second is having a reliable power supply and

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.319
internet connection.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.019
Power can be supplied by batteries or electrical
outlet.

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.019
​Third, data storage and data visualization

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.489
are key to realizing the benefits of the water
sensor package.

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.840
Data can be stored locally on the microcomputer
connected to the sensors or transmitted over

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.590
the internet and stored in the cloud.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.910
Internet access requires either a wireless
or hard-wired connection and the necessary

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.840
network requirements.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.790
​Fourth, develop a plan for communicating and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.980
sharing the data.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.290
What’s needed will depend on the project
goals and the organization’s needs.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.599
It is important to have a strategy for clear
communication and a data sharing plan in place.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.579
​Fifth, the sensors, hardware, and software

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.500
require routine maintenance and periodic upgrades
and replacements.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.230
Personnel are required to monitor and maintain
the system. ​
