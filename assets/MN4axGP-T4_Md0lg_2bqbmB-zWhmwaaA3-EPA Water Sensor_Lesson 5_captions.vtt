00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.050
Microcomputer kits are commercially available
with resources available to get started.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.130
The Raspberry Pi computing application was
used for the sensors in the building example

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.140
just covered.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.820
The product and similar ones are good options
for constructing DIY sensor kits because of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
the ability to perform electronics and coding
tasks to activate the sensor kit.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.016
Remember, detailed information about constructing kits and programming

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:35.450
the microcomputer are available in the Resources.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.290
Here is a little more information about activating
the microcomputer.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.410
To get started Raspbian Operating System is
flashed onto an SD card.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.160
Also many Raspberry Pi kits are sold with
NOOBS installer already pre-loaded onto the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.030
SD card so that you can install directly during
the first boot-up of the system.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.400
This hardware is the microcomputer product
used in the under-the-sink water sensor kit.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.100
It is a product that can store, process, and
display data.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.960
After you have the hardware, relevant coding
is needed to activate the microcomputer.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.210
Download the sensorkit.py file from the provided
github repository link.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.790
Place the file on Raspberry Pi or any computer
folder you want to operate from.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.510
Computer codes were written for the under-the-sink
water sensor kit.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.460
The codes are available for use.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.420
Look for the link in the Resources section.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.190
Data can be retrieved and stored either manually
or with online access.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.030
After the program is running, a "data.csv"
file is automatically generated and saved

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.159
in the same folder as where the Python program
resides.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.410
Sensor data is logged every five minutes.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.980
To remove the data file a USB drive can be
used to copy the file to another location,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.560
and then open the file with Excel or another
spreadsheet application of your choice.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.310
The Raspberry pi has ethernet and WiFi capabilities
for connecting to the internet.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.670
Sensor output can be connected to any online
database such as Google Sheets.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.090
Exported data can be used to host an online
dashboard.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.450
The dashboard helps with visualizing data.
