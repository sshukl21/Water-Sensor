00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.139
This is the exterior view of the water sensor
kit with the display screen, on/off switch,

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.880
access for wiring, connections for sensors,
and inlet/outlet for water to flow through

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.400
the sensor kit.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.710
The kit is made from a hard, waterproof case
that allows the kit to be deployed in wet

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.380
and dry environments both indoor and outdoor.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.550
Kits can be deployed using the internal water-quality-sensor
flow cell by connecting the inlet to a water

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.550
source.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.920
The kit can also be used by connecting sensors
to the case and then measuring grab samples.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.820
The data are stored locally on a microcomputer
in the case.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.420
The water sensor kit can be powered by battery
or plugged into an electrical outlet.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.469
This is the interior of the water sensor kit.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.359
Inside there is a flow cell with water quality
sensor, microcomputer, battery, and associated

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.359
wiring.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.420
The flow cell in the kit includes two sensors
and can be designed differently depending

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.969
on monitoring needs.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.800
This is a general wiring diagram applicable
for the under-the-sink water sensor kit shown

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.250
in the first video.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.720
Microcomputers such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino
are designed to be wired and programmed by

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.970
the user.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.610
With the option to power a water sensor kit
by battery or an electrical outlet, the kit

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.691
can be designed to alternate between the two
power sources depending on the application.

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.030
A detailed description of the sensor kit is
available for download.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.180
