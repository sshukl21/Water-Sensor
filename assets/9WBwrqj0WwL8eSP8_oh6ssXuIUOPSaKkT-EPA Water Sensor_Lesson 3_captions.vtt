00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.540
This water sensor kit is using the internal
flow cell for in-line monitoring using flexible

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.100
tubing to connect the building water to the
kit inlet.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.320
Water exits the flow cell via the kit outlet
and is directed to a drain.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.370
This sensor is monitoring conductivity and
temperature in real-time.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.380
The information could be useful upstream and/or
downstream of a reverse osmosis unit to provide

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.850
high purity water.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.469
In-line monitoring is the primary mode of
measurement.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.870
The flow-thru cell is designed to connect
in-line with your existing water flow, all

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.350
that is needed is flexible tubing to connect
from your water stream to the flow cell.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.310
If suitable, the sensor kit can be installed
in-line with the water stream being measured,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.670
the connections on either end of the flow
cell are push-to-connect fittings and it does

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.410
not matter which side is the entrance and
which is the exit.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.480
Most likely, it will be more convenient to
branch off the measured water stream with

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.149
a tee and connect that smaller stream to the
flow cell and discard the effluent to a drain

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.119
or storage tank with an appropriate length
of tube segment.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.850
Here is another in-line monitoring example
but using an external flow cell that is part

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.150
of an existing process.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.609
For this monitoring example of conductivity
and pH, water sensors are connected to the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:32.259
BNC connectors on the kit and then the sensors
are inserted into the process flow cell.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.149
Real-time readings for conductivity and pH
are displayed.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.150
The advantage of this sensor application is
that it can be deployed quickly to troubleshot

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.270
a process and provide guidance on whether
permanent monitoring is required.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.360
Here is a sensor used for drop-in monitoring
in an indoor setting.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.429
Drop-in monitoring can be configured to monitor
numerous samples or processes throughout a

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.979
building or facility.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.950
Drop-in monitoring is useful when it is easier
to drop the sensors into the water stream

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.899
or volume being measured instead of using
the flow cell.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.670
Drop-in measurement involves connecting the
sensors to the external BNC connectors.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.230
Conductivity and pH sensors are connected
to the sensor kit and used to monitor a water

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530
sample or solution.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.400
For drop-in monitoring the sensors are moved
from the internal flow cell to the BNC bulkhead

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.470
connectors.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.700
Specifics about how to do the conversion are
in the Mobile Water Sensor Handbook in Resources.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.310
This is an outdoor setting example for drop-in
monitoring.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.870
The sensors are deployed in surface water
to analyze conductivity and pH.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.620
Other outdoor drop-in monitoring might be
useful in decorative fountains, stormwater

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.810
impoundments, and outdoor water bodies.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.420
Remember, the heavy-duty construction of the
water sensor kit and case allows it to be

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.620
used indoors or outdoors.
